## My components are visible in the raw test route but cut off when displayed in the dev site frame

When components are displayed in the raw route there is an unbroken chain of height 100%s set on the components such that test components with 100% height will fill the available area. With pages, for aesthetic reasons we do not provide an 100% height on all wrapping components, To ensure components display correctly in both raw routes and pages either use block layout or define a fixed hight above any components expecting 100% height.
