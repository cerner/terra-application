# How To Manage Pending Actions

A typical application allows its users to navigate between different components to complete different workflows. However, sometimes the user has not completed their current work before attempting to navigate elsewhere in the application. In these cases, it makes sense to prevent that navigation until the user explicitly accepts that they are leaving the current workflow and may lose unsaved changes.

Components that want to communicate the presence of their unsaved state to the framework can do so by rendering a [NavigationPrompt](/components/terra-application/application/reference/components/navigation-prompt) component. When mounted, the NavigationPrompt will register itself with any and all [NavigationPromptCheckpoints](/components/terra-application/application/reference/components/navigation-prompt-checkpoint) that are ancestors to it.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import NavigationPrompt from 'terra-application/lib/navigation-prompt';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [hasPendingState, setHasPendingState] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>This component toggles between having and not having pending state.</p>
      <p>
        <button type="button" onClick={() => { setHasPendingState(!hasPendingState); }}>
          {hasPendingState ? 'Clear Pending State' : 'Set Pending State'}
        </button>
      </p>
      {hasPendingState ? <NavigationPrompt description="ExampleComponent" /> : undefined}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

Within `terra-application`, the following components respond to the presence of NavigationPrompts:

* [ApplicationBase](/components/terra-application/application/reference/components/application-base) - NavigationPrompts rendered within children will result in prompting prior to window unload events.
* [ModalManager](/components/terra-application/application/reference/components/modal-manager)/[SlidePanelManager](/components/terra-application/application/reference/components/slide-panel-manager) - NavigationPrompts rendered within disclosed components will result in prompting prior to disclosure dismissal.
* [ApplicationNavigation](/components/terra-application/application/reference/components/application-navigation) - NavigationPrompts rendered within children will result in prompting prior to executing callbacks for primary navigation item and 'Logout' selection.

While these are the provided integrations, any component that navigates between stateful components can implement a [NavigationPromptCheckpoint](/components/terra-application/application/reference/components/navigation-prompt-checkpoint) itself to utilize the same registration and prompting logic.
