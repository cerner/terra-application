# How to Use Translated Strings

Translated strings can be retrieved using the `intl` object provided by `injectIntl` HOC-generator provided by [react-intl](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl/blob/master/docs/API.md#injectintl).

> Note: The `intl` value is provided by [ApplicationBase](/reference/terra-application/components/application-base). The version of react-intl required by terra-application (2.9.0) is **not** the latest version.
