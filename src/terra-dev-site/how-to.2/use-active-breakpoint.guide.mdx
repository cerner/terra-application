# How to Use Active Breakpoint

The active breakpoint value can be determined by using the [ActiveBreakpointContext](/reference/terra-application/contexts/active-breakpoint-context). Components that use the ActiveBreakpointContext will be updated whenever the active breakpoint value changes.

> Note: An ActiveBreakpointContext value is provided by [ApplicationBase](/reference/terra-application/components/application-base).
