# Upgrade Guide

## Upgrading from terra-application v1 to terra-application v2

### Unsupported functionality from V1

The following features are no longer supported with terra-application-v2

- **Custom locales**:
Custom locales are no longer are supported due to react-intl v5 & webpack limitations.
Terra currently supports the following locales:

  * en
  * en-AU
  * en-CA
  * en-US
  * en-GB
  * es
  * es-US
  * es-ES
  * de
  * fr
  * fr-FR
  * nl
  * nl-BE
  * pt
  * pt-BR
  * sv
  * sv-SE

- **Custom terra-base implementation**:
  `terra-base` and `terra-i18n` are deprecated and not supported alongside terra-application v2.
  If these dependencies are installed, then they must be removed.
  If there are custom implementations utilizing these dependencies then they must be rewritten to utilize `terra-application/application-base`.

### Prerequisites
Upgrading to terra-application v2 has the following requirements:

- Upgrading the project to Node 14. Terra-application v2 requires a minimum of Node 14, therefore the project must be up
- Upgrading the project to Jest 29. If `jest-config-terra` is used, then it should be upgraded to v3.
  Refer to the upgrade guide for `jest-config-terra` on how to upgrade to v3.
        
It is recommended to complete these prerequisites before upgrading to terra-application v2 to make the upgrade easier.

### Code changes

#### Dependency updates

Once the prerequisites listed above are complete, the project can be upgraded to terra-application v2.
terra-application v2 requires the following dependences versions to be updated as part of the upgrade process:
* terra-aggregate-translations must be updated to v3.
* webpack-config-terra must be updated to v4. 
* terra-dev-site must be updated to v8.
* rect-intl must be updated to v5 as the above dependences and terra-application v2 all require v5 as a peerDependency.

#### Import updates

Terra-application now uses proper submodule export partterns.
The table below maps the old imports to the new imports.

#### `react-intl` updates

react-intl v5 no longer exports `intlShape`. All usage of `intlShape` would need to be updated as follows:

```js
// before
intl: intlShape.isRequired,

// after
intl: PropTypes.shape({ formatMessage: PropTypes.func }).isRequired,
```

For more information, refer to the react-intl upgrade guides. You may need to refer to the v3 & v4 upgrade guides in addition to v5.
