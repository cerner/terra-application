# How to Render Loading Overlays

Loading overlays can be rendered within the framework by rendering an [ApplicationLoadingOverlay](/reference/terra-application/components/application-loading-overlay) component. Overlays will be rendered by the closest ancestor [ApplicationLoadingOverlayProvider](/reference/terra-application/components/application-loading-overlay).

Any component that wants to create an overlay container for its children can render its own [ApplicationLoadingOverlayProvider](/reference/terra-application/components/application-loading-overlay) to scope overlay presentation to that container.

> Note: ApplicationLoadingOverlayProviders are provided by [ApplicationBase](/reference/terra-application/components/application-base), [ModalManager](/reference/terra-application/components/modal-manager), and the [SlidePanelManager](/reference/terra-application/components/slide-panel-manager).
