# How To Use Event Emitter

Any react component can use EventEmitter to send events for notification purposes. Listeners can be registered and removed at any given time. It is important to remove all listeners before the component or application is unmounted to prevent memory leaks. It is also a good practice to remove listeners at any point when they are no longer needed. See this [example](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html#explanation-why-effects-run-on-each-update) using the `useEffect` hook for removing listeners

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import EventEmitter from 'terra-application/lib/utils/event-emitter';

class EventEmitterExample extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
      counter: 0,
    };

    this.listener = this.listener.bind(this);
    this.eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.eventEmitter.on('increment-counter', this.listener);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.eventEmitter.removeAllListeners();
  }

  listener() {
    this.setState({counter: this.state.counter + 1});
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>Event Emitter</h3>
        <p>The EventEmitter is used to facilitate communications within the application. Clicking the emitter button emits an event to the Listener to increment the value by 1.</p>
        <p>
          Emitter:
          {' '}
          <button type="button" onClick={() => { this.eventEmitter.emit('increment-counter'); }} >
            {'Emit event to increment'}
          </button>
        </p>
        <p>
          Listener:
          {' '}
          {this.state.counter}
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

export default EventEmitterExample;
```

Events are emitted to listeners synchronously in the order in which they were registered. For this reason, it is important ensure that events are emitted in the proper sequence to avoid logical errors.
