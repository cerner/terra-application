# ApplicationBase

The ApplicationBase component is the entrypoint into the Terra application framework.

> Note: ApplicationBase renders the Base component (from `terra-base`) around its children. Components rendered within ApplicationBase should not render a separate Base instance.

## Usage

```jsx
import ApplicationBase from 'terra-application/lib/application-base';
```

## Props

<PropsTable />

## Features

### I18n

ApplicationBase exposes a prop for defining the application's locale. ApplicationBase renders an [IntlProvider](https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/components/terra-i-18-n/i-18-n/i-18-n) (from [react-intl](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl)) as well as a [ApplicationIntlContext](/components/terra-application/application/reference/contexts/application-intl-context).Provider around its children. Children can access the intl APIs by using the [ApplicationIntlContext](/components/terra-application/application/reference/contexts/application-intl-context)) or by using react-intl's provided components directly.

### Theming

ApplicationBase exposes props to define the application's theme.

### Breakpoints

ApplicationBase renders an [ActiveBreakpointContext.Provider](/components/terra-application/application/reference/contexts/active-breakpoint-context) around its children. Children can access the current active breakpoint value by using the [ActiveBreakpointContext](/components/terra-application/application/reference/contexts/active-breakpoint-context).

### Exception Handling

ApplicationBase renders an [ApplicationErrorBoundary](/components/terra-application/application/reference/components/application-error-boundary) around its children. If the children throw exceptions during React lifecycle functions, ApplicationBase will catch the exceptions and render a styled error component in place of the children.

### Loading Overlays

ApplicationBase renders an [ApplicationLoadingOverlayProvider](/components/terra-application/application/reference/components/application-loading-overlay) around its children. Any [ApplicationLoadingOverlay](/components/terra-application/application/reference/components/application-loading-overlay) components rendered by children will result in loading overlays being rendered by ApplicationBase.

### Pending Actions

ApplicationBase monitors its children for the presence of rendered [NavigationPrompts](/components/terra-application/application/reference/components/navigation-prompt). ApplicationBase will ensure that the user is prompted using a browser-native confirmation dialog prior to any window unload event if any [NavigationPrompts](/components/terra-application/application/reference/components/navigation-prompt) are rendered at the time of the unload request.

### Code Splitting

ApplicationNavigation renders a [Suspense](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy) component around its children. If any child components or their descendants are lazy loaded using [React.lazy](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy), a sensible fallback will be rendered while the component is being retrieved. The fallback will render below the ApplicationNavigation header and allow the header to remain interactable.
