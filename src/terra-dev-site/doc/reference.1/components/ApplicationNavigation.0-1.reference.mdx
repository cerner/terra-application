# ApplicationNavigation

The ApplicationNavigation component is a wrapper around Terra's ApplicationNavigation component that provides a tighter integration with terra-application's features.

## Usage

```jsx
import ApplicationNavigation from 'terra-application/lib/application-navigation';
```

## Props

<PropsTable />

## Features

### Exception Handling

ApplicationNavigation renders an [ApplicationErrorBoundary](/reference/terra-application/components/application-error-boundary) around its children. If the children throw exceptions during React lifecycle functions, ApplicationNavigation will catch the exceptions and render a styled error component in place of the children. This error component will render below the ApplicationNavigation header and allow the header to remain interactable.

### Loading Overlays

ApplicationNavigation renders an [ApplicationLoadingOverlayProvider](/reference/terra-application/components/application-loading-overlay) around its children. Any [ApplicationLoadingOverlay](/reference/terra-application/components/application-loading-overlay) components rendered by children will result in loading overlays being rendered by ApplicationNavigation. The overlay will render below the ApplicationNavigation header and allow the header to remain interactable.

### Code Splitting

ApplicationNavigation renders a [Suspense](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy) component around its children. If any child components or their descendants are lazy loaded using [React.lazy](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy), a sensible fallback will be rendered while the component is being retrieved. The fallback will render below the ApplicationNavigation header and allow the header to remain interactable.

### Pending Actions

ApplicationNavigation monitors its children for the presence of rendered [NavigationPrompts](/reference/terra-application/components/navigation-prompt). ApplicationNavigation will ensure that the user is prompted prior to navigating between primary navigation items and prior to executing destructive session management actions.

> Note: The `disablePromptsForNavigationItems` prop can be provided to disable prompting when navigating between primary navigation items.
