# ApplicationBase

The ApplicationBase component is the entrypoint into the Terra application framework.

> Note: ApplicationBase satisfies the base-level requirements for Terra component usage. Rendering a separate Base component from `terra-base` is not necessary.

## Usage

```jsx
import ApplicationBase from 'terra-application/lib/application-base';
```

## Props

<PropsTable />

## Features

### I18n

ApplicationBase exposes a prop to define the application's locale. Child components can access intl APIs through the [ApplicationIntlContext](/reference/terra-application/contexts/application-intl-context).

### Theming

ApplicationBase exposes props to define the application's theme.

### Breakpoints

ApplicationBase renders an [ActiveBreakpointContext.Provider](/reference/terra-application/contexts/active-breakpoint-context) around its children. Children can access the current active breakpoint value by using the [ActiveBreakpointContext](/reference/terra-application/contexts/active-breakpoint-context).

### Exception Handling

ApplicationBase renders an [ApplicationErrorBoundary](/reference/terra-application/components/application-error-boundary) around its children. If the children throw exceptions during React lifecycle functions, ApplicationBase will catch the exceptions and render a styled error component in place of the children.

### Loading Overlays

ApplicationBase renders an [ApplicationLoadingOverlayProvider](/reference/terra-application/components/application-loading-overlay) around its children. Any [ApplicationLoadingOverlay](/reference/terra-application/components/application-loading-overlay) components rendered by children will result in loading overlays being rendered by ApplicationBase.

### Pending Actions

ApplicationBase monitors the application for the presence of rendered [NavigationPrompts](/reference/terra-application/components/navigation-prompt). ApplicationBase will ensure that the user is prompted prior to closing the application if any [NavigationPrompts](/reference/terra-application/components/navigation-prompt) are rendered at the time of the unload request.
