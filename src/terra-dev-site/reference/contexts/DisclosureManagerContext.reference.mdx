# DisclosureManagerContext

The DisclosureManagerContext defines an communication interface between the ModalManager/SlidePanelManager and application contents.

> Note: A DisclosureManagerContext.Provider is rendered by the ModalManager and SlidePanelManager. Any components rendered within those managers (or disclosed by them) can access a DisclosureManagerContext value without rendering additional providers.

## Context Value

<ContextDefinition />

### `disclose`

The `disclose` function provided through the DisclosureManagerContext is used to present additional content through the provided disclosure manager.

The function expects an Object parameter with the following shape:

|Key|Is Required|Value|
|---|---|---|
|`preferredType`|optional|The String describing the preferred disclosure type. This will be used to match the disclosure request to an appropriate DisclosureManager. Depending on the structuring of managers in a given component, the `preferredType` value may not be honored. If the provided `preferredType` is not supported by any present disclosure managers, the root disclosure manager will perform the disclosure using its own disclosure type, regardless of the `preferredType` value.|
|`size`|optional|The String size desired for the disclosure. One of `tiny`, `small`, `medium`, `large`, `huge`, or `fullscreen`. The functional implementation of this size is determined by the rendering component. `size` should not be provided if `dimensions` are specified.|
|`dimensions`|optional|An Object containing explicit `height` and `width` values for the disclosure. These values may not be honored due to the disclosure type or the available viewport size. `dimensions` should not be provided if a `size` is specified.<br />Supported `height` values include: `'240'`, `'420'`, `'600'`, `'690'`, `'780'`, `'870'`, `'960'`, `'1140'`.<br />Supported `width` values include: `'320'`, `'480'`, `'560'`, `'640'`, `'800'`, `'960'`, `'1120'`, `'1280'`, `'1440'`, `'1600'`, `'1760'`, `'1920'`.|
|`content`|**required**|An Object containing a key and a component describing the component to be disclosed. See the `content` API below.|

`content` Object API:

|Key|Is Required|Value|
|---|---|---|
|`key`|**required**|A String key identifying the component to the DisclosureManager. This key must be unique amongst the set of all actively disclosed component keys.|
|`component`|**required**|A React element that will be disclosed.|

```jsx
disclose({
  preferredType: 'modal',
  size: 'large',
  content: {
    key: 'example-modal',
    component: <ExampleModal />
  },
})
```
